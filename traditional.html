                                <strong></strong>Caldo Verde has a long history in Portuguese cuisine. It originated in
                                the northern region of Portugal, particularly in the Minho province. The soup is
                                believed to have been created by shepherds who used simple ingredients readily available
                                to them, such as potatoes, onions, and kale. Over time, Caldo Verde became a popular
                                dish throughout the country and is now considered one of Portugal's national dishes.
                                It's loved for its comforting flavor and is often enjoyed during festive occasions or as
                                a hearty meal.

                                    a beloved mainstay of Mexican cooking. The history of fajitas, while somewhat
                                    blurred, belongs to the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas and northern Mexico, where
                                    skirt steak was often used as payment to vaqueros (Spanish for “cowboys”). The
                                    vaqueros soon became adept at marinating the steak and devouring its various, tasty
                                    forms.
                                    The mainstream popularity of fajitas truly began in the 70s as restaurants and
                                    concession stands in South Texas awakened the cowboy tradition by grilling skirt
                                    steak on sizzling platters and serving them with flour tortillas. Soon, thanks to
                                    some very satisfied and loyal customers, their popularity exploded.
                                    Soon enough, they became a staple at Mexican restaurants across the state, with many
                                    variations on this simple dish.

                                    tortilla. The term originally referred to skirt steak, the cut of beef first used in
                                    the dish. Popular alternatives to skirt steak include chicken and other cuts of
                                    beef, as well as vegetables instead of meat. Popular condiments include shredded
                                    lettuce, sour cream, guacamole, salsa, pico de gallo, shredded cheese, refried
                                    beans, and diced tomatoes. "Tacos de arrachera" is applied to the northern Mexican
